# Small Android Apps
This repository contains a collection of apps that I have made in order to learn various tools and techniques for Android development (e.g. dependency injection, Android Architecture components, various ways of organizing project structure, etc.). Each project folder contains a more detailed description of the app and a summary of the components used to build it.
